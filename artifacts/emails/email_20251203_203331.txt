RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. [HIGH] Implement Dedicated Customer Support SLA System
   Establish a tiered support system with guaranteed response times (24h for general queries, 4h for urgent issues like delistings). Create dedicated support channels for different product categories (mutual funds, insurance, stocks) with specialized agents and automated escalation for unresolved tickets after 48 hours.
   Addresses: Customer Support Issues

2. [HIGH] Optimize App Performance and Response Times
   Conduct comprehensive performance audit to identify bottlenecks causing slow response times. Implement lazy loading for non-critical UI elements, optimize API calls, and add progress indicators for all user actions. Deploy performance monitoring tools to proactively identify and fix slowdowns.

3. [MEDIUM] Expand Portfolio Tracking and Fix Data Feeds
   Add support for NPS Tier 2, EPF, and EPS tracking to the portfolio dashboard. Fix OBV index volume calculation issues and implement real-time data validation checks. Create user-configurable dashboard widgets so users can customize which investments are displayed prominently.
